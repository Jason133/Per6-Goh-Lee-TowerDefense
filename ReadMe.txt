Project: Tower Defense Game
By: Jason Lee and Andrew Goh

Progress Chart: 
- We initally worked on seperate things; I worked on the java code and he worked on processing
- We tried to combine it, but we couldn't
- We, then worked on processing together. 
- Friday-Sunday: Got the Map Running with the tiles, enemies were moving
- Monday: Got tower placing down, finished shooting
- Tuesday: Implemented a Gold, Level, Score System, and Game Mechanism
- Wednesday: Graphical Updates, Code Adjustments made sure everything ran properly 

How to Play: 
- The enemies start coming immediately, but at a slow speed. 
- They do not have that much health either. 
- It's recommended you place down a tower quickly (the 100 gold one). 
- You start off a 200, but 2 towers are more than enough to suffice for the first few rounds. 
- When you want to place a tower, click the button, and then you can place it. 
- To stop placing it, unclick the button. 
- NOTE: when you get to the later levels, if you try to place other towers while you have NOT unclicked
the previous tower button, your tower placement WILL NOT WORK. 
- There's only one enemy :(, but they gain more speed and more health every round
- Last as long as you can 
- The game terminates when your lives hit 0, and you will receive a sad GAME OVER.
